// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let Friend_names = ["Afridi", "Sameer","Zohaib","Hamza"]
let message = 
Friend_names .forEach(Friend_names =>console.log(`Hello ${Friend_names} How are you`))
