// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guestList = ["Hazma","Sameer","Zohaib"];
guestList.forEach (oneguest => console.log(`Hello ${oneguest} Would you like dinner with me`));
